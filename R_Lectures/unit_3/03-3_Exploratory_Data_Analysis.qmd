## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_cowplot())

Visually exploring your data is often called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Helps you figure out what is going on
- Can identify errors or problems with your data
- An imperative first step to data analysis
- Allows you to feel confident with analyses
- Not a formal process, simply whatever you like to do to examine your data


## EDA with ggplot2

![](../images/Workflow.drawio.png){fig-align="center" width="40%" fig-alt="Flow chart showing different packages in the tidyverse which are used for data analysis."}


## Let's do some EDA on our Bats Data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

bats <- read_csv("../data/bats.csv")
bats[1:10, ]
```


## Summary Tables

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

summary(bats)
```


## Look at Your Data - Boxplots

Different variations, but the most standard recipe is:

1. Median = center line
1. Box = IQR (25th to 75th percentiles)
1. Whiskers at 1.5 x 25th and 75th percentiles
1. Dots for anything outside 1.5 x 25th and 75th percentiles


## Look at Your Data - Boxplots

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-alt: "Boxplot of body mass in female and male bats showing that female bats are slightly larger."

ggplot(data = bats, aes(x = sex, y = mass)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```


## Raw data as an alternative to boxplots

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-alt: "Scatterplot of body mass in female and male bats showing a wide range of masses."

ggplot(bats, aes(x = sex, y = mass)) +
  geom_point(size = 3)

```


## Raw data as an alternative to boxplots

Add a little jitter and transparency on the x axis to keep from overplotting.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-alt: "Scatterplot of body mass in female and male bats with jitter added to avoid overplotting showing a wide range of masses."

ggplot(bats, aes(x = sex, y = mass)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.3), alpha = 0.5, size = 3)

```


## Boxplots and raw data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-alt: "Scatterplot of body mass in female and male bats with jitter added to avoid overplotting overlaid with a boxplot showing a wide range of masses."

ggplot(bats, aes(x = sex, y = mass)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_point(
    position = position_jitter(width = 0.3),
    alpha = 0.5,
    color = "blue",
    size = 3
  )

```

Note `outlier.shape = NA` to suppress plotting outliers with the boxplot.


## Boxplots and raw data

You can "bring the boxplot to the front" by switching the order of `geom_point()` and `geom_boxplot()`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-alt: "Scatterplot of body mass in female and male bats with jitter added to avoid overplotting overlaid with a boxplot on top showing a wide range of masses."

ggplot(bats, aes(x = sex, y = mass)) +
  geom_point(
    position = position_jitter(width = 0.3),
    alpha = 0.5,
    color = "blue",
    size = 3
  ) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 2 / 3, outlier.shape = NA)

```


## Boxplots and coord flips

You can also pick a different variable to group by and flip your axes.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-alt: "Boxplot of reproductive condition in bats with groups on the y-axis."

ggplot(bats, aes(x = condition, y = RFA)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_point(
    position = position_jitter(width = 0.3),
    alpha = 0.5,
    color = "blue",
    size = 3
  ) +
  coord_flip()

```



## Boxplots Re-ordered

Sometimes you want your groups in a specific order, not alphabetical

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-alt: "Boxplot of reproductive condition in bats with groups on the y-axis manually ordered."

bats$condition <- factor(
  bats$condition,
  levels = c("L", "P", "PL", "TD", "NR")
)

ggplot(bats, aes(x = condition, y = RFA)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_point(
    position = position_jitter(width = 0.3),
    alpha = 0.5,
    color = "blue",
    size = 3
  ) +
  coord_flip()

```


## Look at Your Data - Distributions {.smaller}

`geom_histogram()` - allows you to see the distribution of your data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-alt: "Histogram of body mass in bats showing that most bats weigh 10 grams."

ggplot(bats) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = mass), binwidth = 0.5) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18))

```


## Look at Your Data - Distributions {.smaller}

`geom_density()` - normalizes your data instead of counts.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-alt: "Density plot of body mass in bats with sex colored showing that female bats weigh slightly more than males."

ggplot(bats) +
  geom_density(aes(x = mass, fill = sex)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18))

```


## Look at Your Data - Distributions {.smaller}

Let's check the moonlight data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-alt: "Histogram of moonlight data showing mostly small values with a few large observation at 1000."

ggplot(bats) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = moonlight), alpha = 0.5) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18))

```


## Finding suspect observations

```{r}
#| echo: true

bats |>
  select(bat_ID, age, mass, moonlight) |>
  arrange(moonlight)

```


## Finding suspect observations

```{r}
#| echo: true

bats |>
  select(bat_ID, age, mass, moonlight) |>
  arrange(desc(moonlight))

```


## What to do?

1. Are the observations really incorrect?
    - Malfunction
1. Was there a data entry error?
    - Check the original data sheets
1. Make any alterations via code and a new file
    - Leave raw data untouched

## Filter

```{r}
#| echo: true

bats_filt <- bats |>
  filter(moonlight < 100)

max(bats_filt$moonlight)
```


## Replace values

```{r}
#| echo: true

bats$moonlight[bats$moonlight == 1000] <- 100

bats$moonlight[
  bats$moonlight == 990 &
    bats$bat_ID == 155
] <- 99

bats$moonlight[
  bats$moonlight == 990 &
    bats$bat_ID == 1
] <- 0
```


## Double check your fixes

```{r}
#| echo: true

bats |>
  select(bat_ID, age, mass, moonlight) |>
  arrange(moonlight)
```


## Double check your fixes

```{r}
#| echo: true

bats |>
  select(bat_ID, age, mass, moonlight) |>
  arrange(desc(moonlight)) |>
  print(n = 11)
```


## Double check your fixes {.smaller}

Let's re-check the moonlight data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-alt: "Histogram of moonlight data showing a fairly even distribution between 0 and 100."

ggplot(bats) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = moonlight), alpha = 0.5) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18))

```


## Write out the new dataset

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

write_csv(bats, file = "bats_corrected.csv")

```

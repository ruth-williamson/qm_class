## Base R {.nostretch}

Base R refers to the set of code and functions that is automatically included when you install R and loaded when you launch R

![](../images/Base_ex.png){width=60% fig-align="center" fig-alt="IMage showing the base R help for mean()."}


## The Tidyverse {.nostretch}

- Extensions for reading, writing, and working with data (selecting, filtering, aggregating, plotting)

You may notice when you load the tidyverse you get a message that says that some libraries overwrite functions in base R.

- For example, `dplyr` overwrites `filter()` and `lag()`.
    - To use functions from a specific package, you will need to use their full names: `stats::filter()` and `stats::lag()`.


## Should I learn/use base R or Tidyverse?

- Both are useful
    - Learn the basics of both
    - Learn when one tool is better suited for your task


## Analysis workflow - Tidy Data {.nostretch}

![](../images/Workflow.drawio.png){fig-align="center" width="40%" fig-alt="Flow chart showing different packages in the tidyverse which are used for data analysis."}

Perform all manipulation via code (in R)

- Preserves data integrity
- The "hard" way now is the easy way in the long run


## Reading delimited files into R

- csv: `read.csv()`
- tab or otherwise delimited: `read.table()`
- [readr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/index.html), loaded with `tidyverse`
    - `read_delim()`
    - `read_csv()`
    - Like their base R counterparts but with more logical default arguments and behavior
    - Return `tibble`s


## Reading a delimited file

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

dat <- read_csv("../data/composition_data.csv")
dat

```


## Reading Excel files into R

Preferred package: [readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(readxl)
MM <- read_excel("MyFile.xlsx")

```


## Where do your files live?

- To load data into R, you need to tell it where the file is on your computer.
- R will look relative to the "working directory"
- **Always** set this to the "Source File Location" (this is where the script is)
    - Quarto will **always** render this way
    - Do not use `setwd()` (even though you will see it done elsewhere)


## Telling R where to look for files

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

MM <- read_excel("../data/Mouse_Weaning_Data.xlsx", na = "NA")
```

Read file and assign to an object `MM`.

- Look for it in the `data` directory, which is one level up from the working directory (`../`)
- Explicitly define "NA" is `NA`


## The pipe `|>`

- R allows you to chain operations together with a pipe: `|>`
- Passes the object from the previous operation to the next

```{r}
#| echo: true

sqrt(c(1, 5, 13))
c(1, 5, 13) |>
  sqrt()
```

- Read left-to-right, top-to-bottom
- You will also see the `magrittr::%>%`


## Getting basic information: base

```{r}
#| echo: true

MM |>
  str()

```


## Getting basic information: tidyverse

```{r}
#| echo: true

MM |>
  glimpse()

```


## Analysis workflow - Tidy Data {.nostretch}

![](../images/Workflow.drawio.png){fig-align="center" width="80%" fig-alt="Flow chart showing different packages in the tidyverse which are used for data analysis."}


## Moving between wide and long (tidy data)

Two important functions to learn:

1.  **`pivot_longer()`** - when some of the column names are not the names of variables but the *values* of the variables

1.  **`pivot_wider()`** - when an observation for a single ID is scattered across multiple rows


## `pivot_longer()`

Column names are not the names of variables but the *values* of the variables.

```{r}
table4a
```

- Here for example, 1999 and 2000 are both values of the variable `year`
- Note the backticks around 1999 and 2000


## `pivot_longer()` {.nostretch}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

table4a

pivot_longer(
  table4a,
  cols = c("1999", "2000"),
  names_to = "year",
  values_to = "cases"
)

```


## `pivot_longer()`

![](https://imgur.com/157Odvw.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Image showing pivoting data from wide to long format."}


## `pivot_wider()`

Observations are across multiple rows.

- Here data from Afghanistan in 1999 is in multiple rows

```{r}
print(table2, n = 8, width = Inf)
```


## `pivot_wider()`

```{r}
#| echo: true

pivot_wider(table2, names_from = type, values_from = count)
```


## `pivot_wider()` {.nostretch}

## Selecting and filtering

- Selecting columns
- Filtering a subset of rows


## Selecting columns: Base R

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

MM$WnMass

```

`$` returns a single column from a `data.frame`. You'll use this form most often day to day.


## Selecting columns: Base R

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

MM[, "WnMass"] # Only the column WnMass, all rows
MM[, 1:3] # Columns 1-3, all rows

```

`[rows, columns]` returns rows and columns from a `data.frame`.

If either is empty, all are returned.

- All rows are returned here. The space before `,` is empty.


## Selecting columns: tidyverse

If you want to select certain columns, use `select()`. For example, select the column `WnMass`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

MM |>
  select(WnMass)

```


## Selecting rows: Base R

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

MM[1, ] # Row 1, all columns
MM[1:5, ] # Rows 1-5, all columns

```

- The space after `,` is empty, so all columns are returned.


## Selecting rows: tidyverse

Variations of `slice()`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

MM |> slice(1)
MM |> slice(1:5)

MM |> slice_head(n = 10)
MM |> slice_tail(n = 10)

MM |> slice_max(order_by = WnMass, n = 10)
MM |> slice_min(order_by = WnMass, n = 10)

MM |> slice_sample(n = 10)
MM |> slice_sample(prop = 0.25)
```


## Logical Operators

You can filter with logical or Boolean operators to select various sets.

- `==` is "equal"
- `&` is "and"
- `|` is "or"
= `!` is "not"


## Logical Operators {.nostretch}

![](https://imgur.com/MiHIo1n.png){width=80% fig-align="center" fig-alt="Image showing different kinds of logical or Boolean operators."}


*Boolean operators. The left circle is x, the right circle is y, and the shaded region indicates the given subset selected.*


## Filtering rows: Base R

- Note that you must include the name of the `data.frame` you are subsetting inside `[ ]`: `MM$BYear`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

MM[MM$BYear == 2008, ]

```


## Filtering rows: Base R

Use `head()` to get a peek at the first few rows. A second `n = ` argument to `head()` specifies the number of rows to show.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

head(MM[, c("MouseID", "Sex")], n = 10)

```


## Filtering rows: tidyverse

`filter()`: The first argument is the object to filter, and the following arguments are the expressions for how you want to filter.

So say we only want to keep female mice.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

filter(MM, Sex == 1)

```


## Filtering

Or we only want to keep female mice with a weaning mass above 15 g.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# tidyverse version 1
filter(MM, Sex == 1, WnMass > 15)

# tidyverse version 2
filter(MM, Sex == 1 & WnMass > 15)

# base
MM[MM$Sex == 1 & MM$WnMass > 15, ]

```


## Filtering

Remember, if we use the `|>` we don't have to specify the object.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

MM |>
  filter(Sex == 1, WnMass > 15)

```


## Filtering

Or you could get the same result by asking for mice that are not (`!=`) male.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

MM |>
  filter(Sex != 0, WnMass > 15)

```


## Filtering

Or you want the set of mice from *either* sire 231x or sire 220x

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

MM |>
  filter(SireID == "231x" | SireID == "220x")

```


## Writing Files: tidyverse

- When you have a processed data file you want to save, use `write_csv()`, or `write_txt()`.
- It will save to your working directory (or specify a specific path).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

M_sub_sires <- MM |>
  filter(SireID == "231x" | SireID == "220x")

write_csv(M_sub_sires, "M_sires_231_220.csv")
```

_Note_ it will always rewrite your old file if you re-run your code. This is a good thing.


## Writing Files: base R

- The functions `write.csv` and `write.txt` are in base R.
- When using these, specify `row.names = FALSE` to prevent the row numbers from saving to the file
- We recommend using the tidyverse versions instead


## Writing Excel file

- Writing Excel files is possible
- `writexl::write_xlsx(object, "path", use_zip64 = FALSE)`
- Ask yourself if you need to do this?
    - `csv` almost always preferred

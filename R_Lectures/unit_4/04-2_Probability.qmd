## Uncertainty & Science

> Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty—some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely certain (Feynman)

Probability is a way to quantify uncertainty.


## Why learn probability?

Basis of logical deduction

- Should you fly or drive?
- Should you not eat raw cookie dough?

Basis of inference systems

- Frequentist, likelihood and Bayesian


## Basics of probability

The probability of an event is the proportion of times the event would occur if a random trial is repeated infinitely under constant conditions.


## Basics of probability

The probability of an event is the **proportion** of times the event **would** occur **if** a **random** trial is repeated **infinitely** under **constant conditions**.

- proportion
- would occur
- if
- random trial
- infinitely
- constant conditions


## Basics of probability

The probability of an event is the **proportion** of times the event **would** occur **if** a **random** trial is repeated **infinitely** under **constant conditions**.

## Basics of probability

Probabilities are proportions.

Pr[event] is the abbreviation for “the probability of
event A occurring.”

- $Pr[heads] = 0.50$: Heads
- $Pr[heads'] = 0.50$: *Not* heads

The range of probabilities for an event is 0 $\rightarrow$ 1
(including 0 and 1).


## Addition rule: Mutually exclusive

*Mutually exclusive* events are events that are not simultaneously possible due to constraints of physics, biology, development, evolution, etc.

- $Pr[A~and~B] = Pr[A, B] = 0$
- Probability of A and B occurring simultaneously.
- e.g., You can't flip a coin heads and tails in one trial
    - $Pr[H, T] = 0$
- $Pr[A~or~B] = Pr[A] + Pr[B]$


## Addition rule: Mutually exclusive

On a single die roll, what is the probability of rolling *either* a 1 *or* a 2?

On a single die roll, what is the probability of rolling *either* a 1, a 2, *or* a 3?


## Multiplication rule: Independent events

If events are *independent*, then their individual probabilities do not influence each other.

- The occurrence of one does not alter the probability of the other.
- Successive coin flips / die rolls / roulette wheel spins
- Offspring sex
- Seed germinating


## Multiplication rule: Independent events

$$Pr[A, B] = Pr[A] \times Pr[B]$$
In two successive die rolls, what is the probability of rolling  a 1 *followed by* a 2?

In three successive die rolls, what is the probability of rolling  a 1 *followed by* a 2, *followed by* a 6?

## Multiplication rule: Independent events

$$Pr[Kernel~1, Kernel~2] = Pr[Kernel~1] \times Pr[Kernel~2]$$

## Binomial probabilities

You plant 10 kernels:

- What is the probability of 0 germinating?
- What is the probability of 10 germinating?
- What is the probability of any 5 germinating?

## Binomial Distribution

- Probability distributions are basically like counting the ways things can happen
- In R, you can "flip a coin" using the binomial distribution.
- The function is `rbinom()`. Try one flip: `rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)`


## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin once, possible outcomes are H or T. How many ways are there to get one H? One T?

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-alt: "Histogram showing 1 head and 1 tail have equal number of ways."

flip1 <- tibble(
  Ways = c(1, 1),
  Flips = c("1 Head", "1 Tail")
)

flip1 |> ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) + geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
```


## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin twice, what are the possible outcomes?

1. HH
1. HT, TH
1. TT

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "Histogram showing the 1 head and 1 tail has more ways than 2 head or 2 tail."

flip2 <- tibble(
  Ways = c(1, 2, 1),
  Flips = c("2 Head", "1 Head, 1 Tail", "2 Tail")
) |>
  mutate(Flips = fct_inorder(Flips))

flip2 |> ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) + geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
```


## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin 3 times, what are the possible outcomes?

1. HHH
1. HHT, HTH, THH
1. TTH, THT, HTT
1. TTT

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "Histogram showing the number of ways to get combinations of heads and tails for 3 flips."

flip3 <- tibble(
  Ways = c(1, 3, 3, 1),
  Flips = c("3 Head", "2 Head, 1 Tail", "1 Head, 2 Tail", "3 Tail")
) |>
  mutate(Flips = fct_inorder(Flips))

flip3 |> ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) + geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
```


## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin 4 times, what are the possible outcomes?

1. HHHH
1. HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, THHH
1. HHTT, HHTH, HTHT, THTH, HTTH, THHT
1. TTTH, TTHT, THTT, HTTT
1. TTTT

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "Histogram showing the number of ways to get combinations of heads and tails for 4 flips."

flip4 <- tibble(
  Ways = c(1, 4, 6, 4, 1),
  Flips = c(
    "4 Head",
    "3 Head, 1 Tail",
    "2 Head, 2 Tail",
    "1 Head, 3 Tail",
    "4 Tail"
  )
) |>
  mutate(Flips = fct_inorder(Flips))

flip4 |> ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) + geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
```


## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin 6 times, what are the possible outcomes?

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "Histogram showing the number of ways to get combinations of heads and tails for 6 flips."

flip6 <- tibble(
  Ways = c(1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1),
  Flips = c(
    "6 H",
    "5 H, 1 T",
    "4 H, 2 T",
    "3 H, 3 T",
    "2 H, 4 T",
    "1 H, 5 T",
    "6 T"
  )
) |>
  mutate(Flips = fct_inorder(Flips))

flip6 |> ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) + geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
```


## Binomial probabilities

You plant 10 kernels:

- What is the probability of 0 germinating?
- What is the probability of 10 germinating?
- What is the probability of *exactly* 5 germinating?

![](../images/Probability_Constant.drawio.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Flow chart showing how to calculate probability of different combinations of germinating kernels."}


## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of 0 germinating?

```{r}
#| echo: true

0.25^10
dbinom(x = 0, size = 10, prob = 0.75)
```

![](../images/Probability_Constant.drawio.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Flow chart showing how to calculate probability of different combinations of germinating kernels."}

---

What is the probability of 10 germinating?

```{r}
#| echo: true

0.75^10
dbinom(x = 10, size = 10, prob = 0.75)
```

![](../images/Probability_Constant.drawio.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Flow chart showing how to calculate probability of different combinations of germinating kernels."}

---

What is the probability of *exactly* 5 germinating?

```{r}
#| echo: true

dbinom(x = 5, size = 10, prob = 0.75)
```

![](../images/Probability_Constant.drawio.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Flow chart showing how to calculate probability of different combinations of germinating kernels."}


## What is the probability of 5 *or more* germinating?

Binomial probability for 5 to 10 successes from 10 trials ($Pr = 0.75$)

```{r}
#| echo: true

dbinom(x = 5:10, size = 10, prob = 0.75)
```

. . .

Sum the probabilities:

```{r}
#| echo: true

sum(dbinom(x = 5:10, size = 10, prob = 0.75))
```


## Fixed probability questions

How many kernels should I plant overall?

- For a desired harvest size

How many kernels should I plant per seed hill?

- To get at least 1 successful germination

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

sum(dbinom(1:3, 3, prob = 0.75))
```


## Fixed probability in experimental design

- How many [mice/rats/fruit flies] should I pair assuming all won't successfully reproduce?
- How many replicates should I set up, knowing that some might fail?
- How many patients should I enroll in a study, assuming some will drop out?
